database_tables.sql
-run this first to add the necessary tables to a database
-modify the database name to match the one you require

app/config.php
-holds all the configuration data for the application
-substitute your own DB host, DB user, and DB password for the appropriate fields
-the default DB used is 'imago', you may want to change this as well depending on what database is being used
-change galleryBase in the config array to point to the base of the picture folder (i'm not exactly sure this is still used :\, maybe for the import script)

TODO
-there are various TODO's scattered throughout the source code
-need a way to upload pictures, there is an html5 skeleton for drag-and-drop in the picture.upload.js views folder but nothing concrete yet (i have a script somewhere that crawls folders and adds pictures and their thumbnails to the appropriate places in the database)
-tests
  -none so far
  -currently looking at jasmine bdd and sinion spying framework (http://tinnedfruit.com/2011/03/03/testing-backbone-apps-with-jasmine-sinon.html)

Resources
I used James Yu's tutorial for a single page backbone.js app as a base (http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/01/27/cloudedit-a-backbone-js-tutorial-by-example/)

RDA's backbone tutorial also provided inspiration (http://mobile.rdacorp.com/2011/05/venturing-into-backbonejs-territory.html)
